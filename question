1. Introduction
This document outlines the Low-Level Design (LLD) for an Online Learning Management System (LMS), 
enabling instructors to create courses, manage students, and track learning progress. The system allows 
students to enroll, take quizzes, access resources, and view progress.
This design supports both Java (Spring Boot) and .NET (ASP.NET Core) frameworks for backend 
development.
2. Module Overview
2.1 Course Management Module
• Manage course creation, editing, deletion, and categorization.
• Assign instructors to courses and set course prerequisites.
2.2 User Registration and Profile Management Module
• Allows users (students and instructors) to register, log in, and manage profiles.
2.3 Enrollment and Access Management Module
• Students can enroll in courses and access learning materials.
2.4 Quiz and Assessment Module
• Instructors create quizzes and assessments. Students can take quizzes and receive feedback.
2.5 Progress Tracking and Reports Module
• Track student progress across courses, including quiz scores and completed lessons.
3. Architecture Overview
3.1 Architectural Style
• Frontend: Angular or React
• Backend: REST API-based architecture
• Database: Relational Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)
3.2 Component Interaction
• The frontend communicates with the backend via REST APIs for course browsing, 
enrollment, quiz management, and profile management.
• The backend handles user authentication, course creation, enrollment, and quiz/assessment 
management.
4. Module-Wise Design
4.1 Course Management Module
Features:
• Instructors can create, update, and delete courses.
• Course metadata, such as title, description, syllabus, and prerequisites.
Data Flow:
• Instructors initiate course creation/update requests via the frontend.
• The backend validates input, stores course data in the database, and links the course to the 
appropriate instructor.
Entities:
• Course:
o CourseID
o Title
o Description
o Syllabus
o InstructorID
o Prerequisites
4.2 User Registration and Profile Management Module
Features:
• Registration for students and instructors.
• Profile management for both students and instructors.
Data Flow:
• Users register via the frontend, providing their details (name, email, role).
• The backend validates user input and stores user details in the database.
• Users can update their profiles through the frontend interface.
Entities:
• User:
o UserID
o Name
o Email
o Password
o Role (Student/Instructor)
4.3 Enrollment and Access Management Module
Features:
• Students can enroll in available courses.
• Manage student access to learning materials.
Data Flow:
• Students browse available courses and submit an enrollment request via the frontend.
• Backend processes enrollment requests and links the student to the chosen course.
Entities:
• Enrollment:
o EnrollmentID
o CourseID
o UserID (Student)
o EnrollmentDate
4.4 Quiz and Assessment Module
Features:
• Instructors create quizzes with multiple-choice or short-answer questions.
• Students take quizzes and get feedback.
Data Flow:
• Instructors create quizzes via the frontend, providing questions and possible answers.
• Students attempt quizzes via the frontend, with answers submitted to the backend for 
evaluation.
Entities:
• Quiz:
o QuizID
o CourseID
o Title
o QuestionList
o TotalMarks
• Answer:
o AnswerID
o QuizID
o UserID
o Response
o Marks
4.5 Progress Tracking and Reports Module
Features:
• Track student performance across courses.
• Generate reports based on quiz scores and lesson completion.
Data Flow:
• Students’ quiz attempts and completed lessons are tracked in the backend.
• Reports are generated on demand by the instructor or system for each student.
Entities:
• Progress:
o ProgressID
o UserID (Student)
o CourseID
o CompletedLessons
o QuizScores
5. Deployment Strategy
5.1 Local Deployment
• Frontend: Use ng serve for Angular or equivalent local servers for React.
• Backend: Deploy the REST API locally using Spring Boot or ASP.NET Core.
• Database: Set up a local instance of MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server for testing and 
development.
6. Database Design
6.1 Tables and Relationships
1. Course
o Primary Key: CourseID
o Foreign Key: InstructorID
2. User
o Primary Key: UserID
3. Enrollment
o Primary Key: EnrollmentID
o Foreign Key: UserID, CourseID
4. Quiz
o Primary Key: QuizID
o Foreign Key: CourseID
5. Answer
o Primary Key: AnswerID
o Foreign Key: QuizID, UserID
6. Progress
o Primary Key: ProgressID
o Foreign Key: UserID, CourseID
7. User Interface Design
7.1 Wireframes:
• Course Listing Page
• Course Enrollment Page
• Student Dashboard
• Instructor Dashboard
• Quiz Attempt Page
• Progress Report Page
8. Non-Functional Requirements
8.1 Performance
• The system should be able to support up to 500 concurrent users.
8.2 Scalability
• The design should scale easily to accommodate increasing courses, users, and data.
8.3 Security
• Ensure secure user authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
8.4 Usability
• The system should be intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly across devices.
